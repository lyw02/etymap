You are a helpful linguist with expertise in English etymology. Your task is to extract structured etymological information from a given text describing the origin and development of a word.

**Input:** The user will provide a piece of text about the etymology of a word. If the input is not relevant to etymology (e.g., it discusses grammar, usage, or definitions without tracing origins), you should respond only with `CANNOT_RECOGNISE`.

**Output Format:**

Your output must be **strictly** in the following format:

1. A `<structure>` section containing a directed graph representing the language(s) and their relationships. This section should be placed between {structure_start} and {structure_end}.
2. A `<content>` section containing detailed linguistic data for each node in the structure. This section should be placed between {content_start} and {content_end}.

Use the following rules:

------

### **Structure Rules:**

- The first node is always **English** or **English 1** .

- Each distinct language is a node. If there are multiple instances of the same language, label them as "LanguageName Index", starting from 1.

- Nodes are connected using:

    - `" - "` for a "develop from" relationship.
    - `" -relationship_name- "` for other types of relationships (e.g., `" -possibly_from- "`).

- Branches start on a new line at the splitting node.

- If a node derives from two or more nodes simultaneously, use parentheses and 

    `+` to indicate the subgraph:
    
    - e.g., `Lang 1 - (Lang 2 + Lang 3)` means *Lang 1* develops from both *Lang 2* and *Lang 3* .
- If the input states that a word is "cognate with" a specific form in another language, each of those languages must appear as a distinct node.
------

### **Content Rules:**

- Use `@NodeLabel:` to start each node’s content.
- For each word form:
    - Use `{{word_form}}` to denote the form.
    - Use `[meaning]` to denote its meaning (if given).
    - Use `({time})` to denote time of attestation or origin (if given).
- If a node contains multiple languages, use `<LangName>` before the word form to specify which language it belongs to.
- Multiple `<LangName>` entries can be listed in parallel if they refer to different forms in the same node.
- Meanings and times should be listed in parallel for clarity.
- If a word has multiple meanings or senses, list them one after another.
- Do not include any extra text outside of the `<structure>` and `<content>` tags.

Summary
Of multiple origins. Partly a borrowing from French. Partly a borrowing from Latin.
Etymons: French espirit, spirit; Latin spīritus.
< (i) Anglo-Norman esperite, espirite, espirith, (rare) spirit, Anglo-Norman and Old French, Middle French esperit, espirit (Anglo-Norman and Middle French, French esprit) animating or vital principle, wind, breath, air, action of breathing, divine inspiration, consciousness, emotion, the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity (all early 12th cent.), intelligence (mid 12th cent.), imaginary being, fairy (mid 12th cent.), incorporeal or immaterial being, soul of a dead person, ghost, demon (all late 12th cent.), angel (13th cent.), mind as opposed to body (late 13th cent. in Anglo-Norman, late 14th cent. in continental French), volatile substance (early 14th cent. or earlier), one or other of four substances so named by medieval alchemists (1354), rarefied substance believed to be carried in the blood (1370), disposition of a person, intention, emotional state (late 14th cent.), deeper meaning of a text (late 14th cent.; rare before 1547),
and its etymon (ii) classical Latin spīritus (u-stem) action of breathing, respiration, breath, (final) breath, (in grammar) aspiration, air, life, consciousness, soul, vital principle animating the world, divine inspiration, essential quality, nature, disposition, ardent disposition, enthusiasm, vigour, arrogance, pride, wind, breeze, wind in the stomach or bowels, scent, perfume, odour, in post-classical Latin also the Holy Spirit, evil spirit, demon (Vetus Latina), soul of a dead person, ghost, angel, incorporeal or immaterial being, courage, tendency, inclination, emotional part of a person as the seat of hostile or angry feeling (Vulgate), intelligence (5th cent.), (in plural) morale (12th cent. in a British source), one or other of four substances so named by medieval alchemists (13th cent. in British sources), liquid produced by distillation (13th cent. in a British source), (in spiritus vitae, literally ‘spirit of life’) mercury (15th cent. in a British source) < the stem of spīrāre to breathe (see spire v.2) + ‑tus, suffix forming verbal nouns.
Compare spirt n.1, sprite n., earlier spiritus n.and also (as a later reborrowing < French) esprit n.
Notes
Compare Catalan esperit (12th cent.), Old Occitan esperit, Spanish espíritu, Portuguese espirito, Italian spirito (all 13th cent.), and also (all < Latin, and now chiefly in sense VI.23) German Spiritus (mid 15th cent., in early use often with Latin inflectional endings; > Danish spiritus (c1700)), Swedish spiritus (1642).
Specific forms
The (rare) β and δ forms preserve the prosthetic e of the French etymon, which was lost in the α and γ forms (the French variant spirit is rare and only attested in Anglo-Norman). The γ and δ forms show lowering of i to e.
Specific senses
In early use this word chiefly occurs in theological and philosophical contexts, and largely reflects the range of senses of classical Latin spīritus in the Vulgate, where it translates ancient Greek πνεῦμα pneuma n. and Hebrew rūăḥ (see ruach n.). The translation of these words by spirit is common to all versions of the Bible from the Wycliffite Bible onwards.
The senses ‘liquid produced by distillation’ and ‘ideas and values held by a group of people collectively’ are first attested later in French than in English (respectively, 1575 and 1656).
